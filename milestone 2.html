          <p class="card-text">Full Stack developer with a bachelors of arts in psychology and a certification of completion in coding and web development from the University of Arizona. I am detailed oriented person, who loves being challenged and having to think outside the box. I am creative and enjoy working with teams, or on my own. What motivates me professionally is being challenged on the job, and actually making a positive difference in whatever role I am  in. Being a manager/bartender has given me the abilities to run a team on my own, make sure expectations are being met, and multitask. Being in an admissions office I have gained excellent communication skills and helping individuals make the right education decision. </p>
